In the sidebar, you can select a query, mutation, object, input object, enumeration, interface, union, scalar or directive definition. In the right area of the window, information about the definition appears.

At the top, the definition’s type, name and description is visible. If the definition has got a return type, it is also visible in this area.

In the “Arguments” section, there is a list of the arguments of a query, mutation, input object or directive. It shows the definition’s name, description, type and the directives if there are any.

The “Fields” section lists all of the children of objects and interfaces, again showing the name, description, type and optionally directives.

The “Interfaces” section lists all of the interfaces, while the “Directives” section lists the directives and their arguments.

In the “Directive Locations” section, there is a list of the directive locations of a directive definition. In an enumeration, there is the section “Enum Cases” showing all of the available cases. In unions, “Union Member Types” lists all of the member types.
