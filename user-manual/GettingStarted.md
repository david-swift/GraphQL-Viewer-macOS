# Getting Started

Start by downloading the GraphQL schema from a GraphQL API. Open the `.graphql` file in the GraphQL Viewer app. You should now see all of the queries, mutations, objects, input objects, enumerations, interfaces, unions, scalars and directives in the sidebar.

## Installation
Download the GraphQL Viewer [here][1].
Note that you cannot open apps that are unsigned directly by double-clicking: You have to Ctrl-click on the `GraphQL Viewer.app` file and click on `Open` to open it the first time.

## Development
GraphQL Viewer is an open source project. Visit the [GitHub repository][2] for bug reports, feature requests, pull requests and more information.
